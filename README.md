# ValorGuard
This application keeps you accountable by notifying your accountability partner when you play a Valorant match.

## Motivation
I accumulated over 2,000 hours of playtime on Valorant, often playing several hours a day.
I realized that my addiction to playing this game had interfered with more productive activities like upskilling my software engineering skills, exercising, and other personal goals.
This application helped me to become more productive, saving several hours a day.
